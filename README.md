# AirBnb-Paris-listings--Data-Analysis

Airbnb is a popular online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes or apartments with travelers who need a place to stay. As a host or a guest on Airbnb, you may be interested in analyzing the listings data to gain insights into the market and make informed decisions. In this post, we'll explore how to use SQL to analyze Airbnb listings data.

The Airbnb listings data contains information about the properties that are available for rent on the platform, such as the property type, location, availability, and pricing. The data is available in a CSV file that can be loaded into a SQL database for analysis.
